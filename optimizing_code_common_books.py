# # Optimizing Code: Common Books
# Here's the code your coworker wrote to find the common book ids in `books_published_last_two_years.txt` and `all_coding_books.txt` to obtain a list of recent coding books.

# In[1]:


import time
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np


# In[2]:


with open('books_published_last_two_years.txt') as f:
    recent_books = f.read().split('\n')
    
with open('all_coding_books.txt') as f:
    coding_books = f.read().split('\n')


# In[3]:


start = time.time()
recent_coding_books = []

for book in recent_books:
    if book in coding_books:
        recent_coding_books.append(book)

print(len(recent_coding_books))
print('Duration: {} seconds'.format(time.time() - start))


# ### Tip #1: Use vector operations over loops when possible
# 
# Use numpy's `intersect1d` method to get the intersection of the `recent_books` and `coding_books` arrays.

# In[4]:


start = time.time()
recent_coding_books = np.intersect1d(recent_books,coding_books)  # TODO: compute intersection of lists - Kritika's Solution
print(len(recent_coding_books))
print('Duration: {} seconds'.format(time.time() - start))


# ### Tip #2: Know your data structures and which methods are faster
# Use the set's `intersection` method to get the common elements in `recent_books` and `coding_books`.

# In[5]:


start = time.time()
recent_coding_books = set(recent_books).intersection(coding_books) # TODO: compute intersection of lists - Kritika's solution
print(len(recent_coding_books))
print('Duration: {} seconds'.format(time.time() - start))
